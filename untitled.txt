learning how to commit on github through mobile phone
i wish i knew that you can commit through your phone too, i lost my 33+ days streak because i couldnt use my pc,
someone in my family died so i had to leave from my home 
but still i practiced javascript everyday, but i didnt push code because i didnt know that you could.
